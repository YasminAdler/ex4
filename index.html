            <p id="AboutP">
                As a 26-year-old woman, I grew up in Israel, as one of four children. Currently, I'm pursuing my dream
                of studying software engineering at Shenkar School of Engineering and Design.
                I'm in my second year of the four-year degree program,
                and I'm already excited about the knowledge and skills I'm gaining.
                Before starting my degree, I spent three years in the military as a commander in a combat battalion
                called
                Karakal. This experience taught me valuable leadership and teamwork skills that I carry with me to this
                day.
                After completing my military service, I worked in security at EL AL company in New York. This job
                allowed me
                to understand the importance of security and safety in the tech industry.
                I believe that my skills and experiences will help me succeed in any
                future endeavors that I pursue.
